## Image Classification Using Neural Networks

We'll use our existing knowledge of **PyTorch** and **Deep Learning** to solve a very different kind of problem: image classification. We'll use the famous [MNIST Handwritten Digits Database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) as our training dataset. It consists of 28px by 28px grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9), along with labels for each image indicating which digit it represents.
